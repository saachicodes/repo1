						<h2>The LGBTQ+ Community</h2>
						<p></p>
					</header>

					<p>Those of sexual orientations or gender identities other than heterosexuality and cisgender in today’s society suffer greatly from other people’s ignorance, discriminative behaviour and laws globally that discriminate against them.Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual (as well as pansexual, asexual+) people and Transgender people are often unrecognised or forgotten in society, OR are harassed and abused just for whom they love.</p>
         they are often based on harmful stereotypes and have no depth or strength as a character.

								<h3>Representation in the Media</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Firstly, LGBTQ+ characters are not widely represented because of our heteronormative and cisnormative society (meaning a society that treats being heterosexual as the default and normal, and therefore alienates other sexualities). 82 out of the 100 Top films of 2014 fail to include an LGBTQ+ character.  And when they are, they are often based on harmful stereotypes and have no depth or strength as a character. We believe LGBTQ+ people deserve representation of the same quality and variety as straight people, and to support this belief, you can donate and support the following charities.

                <h3>Discrimination</h3>
                <img src="bullying.jpg"/
              </header>
              <p>85% of students in the UK had heard students or teachers make jokes, insults or negative comments about LGBTQ+ people. 3 out of 5 LGBTQ+ students have reported feeling unsafe in school due to their sexual orientation.

Homophobia in society is an issue that makes homosexual people’s lives much, much more difficult. Biphobia and aphobia do the same, but are the cause of various different experiences, and have come from various different reasons.

								<h3>DIscrimination</h3>
							</header>
							<p>86% of LGBTQ+ Youth have reported being harrassed at school. 82% dealt with bullying due to their sexuality. 58.7% of gender non-conforming students were harrassed because oft their gender expression and 50% of transgender people have been raped or assaulted by a romantic partner. These statistics are shockingly high and reveal how extreme these issues are.

Phobia and harrassment can then also lead to the development of  mental illnesses and suicide. This is why both the phobia and harrassment need to stop in order to save and better so many lives.
