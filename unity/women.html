<h1 >Women's issues and rights</h1>
<h2>In today’s society, women are often treated as second-class; as inferior in a world designed for men and for this reason, often endure the negative effects of prejudice, discrimination and various stereotypes. Here, you will find some of the most pressing issues that negatively affect women and how you can help.

            <h3>abuse:</h3>
              <big><p>The statistics for women being domestically and sexually abused are extremely high. On average every week, 2 women are killed by their partner or ex partner in England and Wales. The police have reported that on average, they receive a call relating to domestic abuse every 30 seconds. These numbers are shocking.

Around 30% of these cases are reported to the authorities and when these women do come forward about their situation, they are often not taken seriously which further discourages women to take steps to protect themselves. An example of this in court and a sexual abuse case, the women is often blamed for the ‘sexual abuse’ being her fault due to the way she was dressed, whether she had drunk an alcohol and so the accused is either let off the hook or given an unreasonably short prison sentence.

Also 75% of these women are abused by someone that they know. This reveals that even with those they trust, women tend to be treated this poorly.

            <h3>the gender pay gap + employment:</h3>
             <p><big> The Telegraph states that since March 2017, women earn 9.4% less than men doing the same job as them, and black women earn 9.5% less. LGBTQ+ and disabled women earn even less. And while this is the smallest gap in history, there has been relatively little progress in the past couple years. Does this seem fair to you?

            <h3>representation in media:</h3>
            <p><big>An issue for most minorities in our society is being underrepresented or negatively represented in movies, television and other types of media.

Women make up 46.3 percent of the workforce, they are only 23.2 percent of characters who work on fil<</ than men in films, revealing how extremely, and to what extent they are sexualised.

Females are often represented in both films, television, and books as purely there for the benefit of the male protagonist, and sometimes as a Manic Pixie Dream Girl (hyperlink: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manic_Pixie_Dreami_Girl). You’d be shocked how many of your favourite films fail to feature two women talking to each other about something other than a man (or the Bechdel Test). Examples are The Imitation Game, Harry Potter and the Dealthy Hallows part 2, 21 Jump Street and more.
