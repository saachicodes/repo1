            <h3>depression:</h3>
              <p>Although both genders suffer from depression and it can affect anyone, men are much less likely to seek and get help - many feel that they should not need help and want to apear strong. Because men are less likely to get help, more men are led to commit suicide than women, even though more women are likely to suffer from mental health issues. Suicide is the biggest killer of young men in britain under 50 - at a rate three times that of women.</p>

            <h3>Violence:</h3>
             <p> Domestic violence and rape against men is often not taken sriously, which can lead to men experiencing traumatic events or abuse, while not feeling like they can have someone to talk to. In addition to mocking from peers regarding domestic violence against men, some police officers can be unsympathetic - this in turn leads to a very low conviction rate and more reoffences.

            <p>According to the national cancer institute, one in eight women will get breast cancer in their lifetime, whereas one in seven men will get prostate cancer. However, prostate cancer is discussed much less and is more stigmatised than breast cancer aswell as much more money and awareness raised for breast cancer.

            <p>Men account for 93% of all workplace deaths in america. Becasue men are still expected to be the breadwinners and earn money by some, men often go into more dangerous lines of work such as construction because they are left with little other choice.</p>
